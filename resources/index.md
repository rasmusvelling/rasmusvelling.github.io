# Resources
MOOCs, blogs and other data science resources I've digested and liked.

## Courses
- [DeepLearning.ai specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), Coursera specialization in Deep Learning and neural networks.

### Automatic differentiation

- [You Should Be Using Automatic Differntiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq2gPzlrM0g) a great video explaining what uto-diff is and how it fits into the Machine Learning product cycle.
- [Autgrad](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/) an implementation of automatic differentiation in Python.

## Misc
