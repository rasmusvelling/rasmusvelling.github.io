# Resources
MOOCs, blogs and other data science resources I've digested and liked.

## Algortihms and model frameworks

### Frameworks - R

- [MBOOST - GAM framework](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mboost/index.html) for fitting and feature selection using (potentilly) non-linear additive models in R.

### Automatic differentiation

- [You Should Be Using Automatic Differntiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq2gPzlrM0g) a great video explaining what uto-diff is and how it fits into the Machine Learning product cycle.
- [Autgrad](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/) an implementation of automatic differentiation in Python.
